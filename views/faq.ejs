                    FNaF Multiverse is a community of FNaF fans created on Discord in 2020 (so this includes a new fan community on FNaF). The main goal of this community is to help the FNaF Franchise to keep growing. We have to admit that this community is not like other FNaF communities which have many events, but that's because we are still developing this community to be better.

                    English. The main language on this server is English. Whether it's British English or something else, as long as it's English, it doesn't matter.<br><br>However, this community in Discord provides a place for you to use languages other than English. You can use those languages in the categories that we have prepared, as well as use the channels that we have prepared as well.

                    Well, first of all, you need to join our <a href="/discord">Discord Server</a>. Because we only take people from our Discord Server, and not outside from it. And also we'll announce it in Discord when we need additional staff.
